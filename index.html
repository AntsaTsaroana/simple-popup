        <h1>What Is Bitcoin?</h1>
        <p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside
            the control of any one person, group, or entity, and thus removing the need for third-party involvement
            in financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for the work done to verify transactions
            and can be purchased on several exchanges.

            Bitcoin was introduced to the public in 2009 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the
            name Satoshi Nakamoto.

            It has since become the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world. Its popularity has inspired the
            development of many other cryptocurrencies. These competitors either attempt to replace it as a payment
            system or are used as utility or security tokens in other blockchains and emerging financial
            technologies.</p>
